A repo collecting recent works on MTMCT

MOT-Duke MTMC challenge
DukeMTMC aims to accelerate advances in multi-target multi-camera tracking. It provides a tracking system that works within and across cameras, a new large scale HD video data set recorded by 8 synchronized cameras with more than 7,000 single camera trajectories and over 2,000 unique identities, and a new performance evaluation method that measures how often a system is correct about who is where.

Current state of the art models

1. DeepCC: Features for Multi-Target Multi-Camera Tracking and Re-Identiﬁcation [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10859.pdf) (online; single camera & multi camera capable; tracker available in early July 2018; detector: OpenPose [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.08050.pdf))
2. MTMC-ReID: Multi-Target,Multi-Camera Tracking by Hierarchical Clustering:  Recent Progress on Duke MTMC Project [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.09531.pdf) (private detector; near online; 1st in Duke MTMC; non-open source; both single and multi-camera; with AlignedReID as detector)
   



Multi Object Tracking Models (single camera)

1. Multiple People Tracking by Lifted Multi-cut and Person Re-identiﬁcation (single camera; unofficial re-implementation on GitHub available: https://github.com/jutanke/cabbage; patent pending)
2. Fusion of Head and Full-Body Detectors for Multi-Object Tracking

More projects will be available soon.
